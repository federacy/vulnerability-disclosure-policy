# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Security is core to our values, and we appreciate the input of security researchers acting in good-faith to help us maintain a high standard for the security and privacy of our users, which includes encouraging responsible vulnerability research and disclosure. This policy sets out our definition of good-faith in the context of finding and reporting vulnerabilities, as well as what you can expect from us in return.

## Expectations

When working with us, according to this policy, you can expect us to:

* Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy;
* Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely initial response to the submission; and
* Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

## Official Channels

Any vulnerability deemed to be in-scope, according to this policy, should be reported directly to this program through the Federacy platform. All communications between the researcher and program team regarding any reported vulnerability should be confined to the comments section of the corresponding report.

## Awards

| Severity | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Systemic compromise | XXE Injection and SQL Injection with significant impact; <br/>RCE and Vertical Authentication Bypass. |
| High | Full access to other user's private data | IDOR, Stored XSS and CSRF with significant impact; <br/>Internal SSRF and Lateral Authentication Bypass. |
| Medium | Limited access to other user's private data | IDOR, Reflective XSS and CSRF with impact. |
| Low | Configuration issues and other <br/>vulnerabilities with limited impact | SSL misconfigurations; <br/>XSS and CSRF with limited impact. |

We award vulnerability reports at our discretion. In order to be eligible for a bounty, your submission must be accepted as in-scope and valid.

The guidelines we use to determine the validity of reports are outlined below.

### Reproducibility

Our engineers must be able to reproduce the vulnerability you have reported. Reports that include clearly written explanations and a working proof of concept are more likely to be awarded.

### Severity and Priority

Generally, more impactful bugs will receive higher awards. Review the chart above for examples of award levels for similar vulnerabilities.

### Award Factors

The amount awarded may vary depending upon the severity of the vulnerability reported and quality of the report. If we receive multiple reports of the same vulnerability, the first clear, reproducible report will be awarded.

We may decide to award higher for clever or more impactful vulnerabilities, decide to award lower for vulnerabilities that require unusual user interaction, decide that a single report constitutes multiple bugs or that multiple reports are so closely related that they only warrant a single award.

## Disclosure

**Discretionary Disclosure:** Researchers may only share vulnerability details with third parties after requesting and receiving explicit permission from the Program.

## Guidelines

To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between legitimate research and malicious attack, we ask that you attempt, in good faith, to:

* **Play by the rules.** Adhere to this policy and any other relevant agreements, e.g., Terms of Service;
* Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly;
* Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience;
* Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us;
* Handle the confidentiality of details of any discovered vulnerabilities according to our Disclosure Policy;
* Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope;
* If a vulnerability provides unintended access to user data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information: Cease testing and submit a report immediately;
* Only interact with accounts you own unless given explicit permission by the account holder;
* Do not engage in extortion.
* Be clear and succinct—a short proof-of-concept link is invaluable;
* Never attempt non-technical attacks—such as social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks—against our employees, users, or infrastructure; and
* Do not view, alter, save, store, transfer, or otherwise access our data or the data of our users without explicit permission.

We may modify the terms or terminate this program at any time.

## In-Scope

Any design or implementation issue that substantially affects the confidentiality or integrity of user data is likely to be considered in-scope. Common examples include:

* Cross-site scripting.
* Cross-site request forgery.
* Mixed-content scripts.
* Authentication or authorization flaws.
* Server-side code execution bugs.
* Circumvention of our permissions model.
* SQL injection.
* XML external entity attacks.

While this list is reflective of the research we prioritize, it should not be considered exhaustive. Any report that concerns the possible compromise of sensitive user data or our systems is of interest. By extension, this includes the reporting of serious security weaknesses in any dependency—such as open source libraries, software, or third-party components—actively used in the development of our properties and/or products shared below.

## Out-of-Scope

The following issues are explicitly outside the scope of this program:

* Policies on presence/absence of SPF/DMARC records.
* Password, email and account policies, such as email id verification, reset link expiration, and password complexity.
* Logout cross-site request forgery.
* Attacks requiring physical access to a user's device.
* XSS on any site other than those listed as 'in-scope'.
* Attacks that require an exploitation tool to overlay on top of our app (e.g., tapjacking).
* Vulnerabilities that require a potential victim to install non-standard software or otherwise take active steps to make themselves susceptible.
* Vulnerabilities affecting users of outdated browsers or platforms.
* Social engineering of our employees or contractors.
* Any physical attempts against our property or data centers.
* Presence of autocomplete attribute on web forms.
* Missing cookie flags on non-sensitive cookies.
* Any access to data where the targeted user needs to be operating a rooted mobile device.

The following issues are outside the scope of our program, unless they are accompanied by evidence of exploitability:

* Use of a known-vulnerable library.
* Missing best practices.
* Insecure SSL/TLS ciphers.
* Missing security headers, which do not directly lead to a vulnerability.
* Lack of CSRF tokens, except when there is evidence of a sensitive user-action not protected by a token.
* Host header injections.
* Reports from automated tools or scans that haven't been manually validated.
* Presence of banner or version information, unless a vulnerable version.

## Known Issues

Any issues already known to us will be published as a separate Known Issues list. These vulnerabilities are also considered out-of-scope, though new reports of a known issue may be accepted if the instances described were not previously observed.

## Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider the research conducted under this policy to be:

* Authorized in view of any applicable anti-hacking laws, and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
* Authorized in view of relevant anti-circumvention laws, and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
* Exempt from restrictions in our Acceptable Usage Policy that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis; and
* Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you, and you have complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report before going any further.

## The Fine Print

This is not a competition, but rather an experimental and discretionary program.

You are solely responsible for any applicable taxes, transaction fees, or other withholdings that arise from or relate to your participation in this program.

Reports from individuals we are prohibited by law from paying are ineligible for awards.
